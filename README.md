Chess Project

Aviv <3, Goat-Lover and I must have rules to make our life easier and make this project great.
So below are the steps we must follow (you may edit them):

The rules of chess: I guess that you know basic chess rules, so there are few things that we must remember.

1) En-Passant: Source - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En_passant

En passant is a move in chess. It is a special pawn capture that can only occur immediately after a pawn makes a double-step move from its starting square, and it could have been captured by an enemy pawn had it advanced only one square. The opponent captures the just-moved pawn "as it passes" through the first square. The result is the same as if the pawn had advanced only one square and the enemy pawn had captured it normally.

The en passant capture must be made on the very next turn or the right to do so is lost. Like any other move, if an en passant capture is the only legal move available, it must be played. En passant capture is a common theme in chess compositions.
